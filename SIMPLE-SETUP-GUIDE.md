```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deployment/setup-aws.sh

# Run the setup script
./deployment/setup-aws.sh
```

### 4.3 What the Script Will Do
The script will:
1. âœ… Create an S3 bucket for your app
2. âœ… Request an SSL certificate for bonusaiapp.tathyas.in
3. âœ… Set up CloudFront (CDN) for fast loading
4. âœ… Configure DNS to point to your app
5. âœ… Build and deploy your app

### 4.4 Manual Steps During Setup
The script will pause and ask you to:
1. **Validate SSL Certificate**: 
   - Go to AWS Console â†’ Certificate Manager
   - Click on your certificate
   - Copy the DNS record shown
   - Add this DNS record to your domain (see Step 5)
   - Wait for validation (5-30 minutes)
   - Return to script and press Y

---

## Step 5: Add DNS Record (SSL Validation)

### Option A: If you manage DNS yourself
1. Go to your domain registrar (where you bought tathyas.in)
2. Find DNS settings
3. Add the CNAME record provided by AWS Certificate Manager

### Option B: If someone else manages your domain
1. Send the DNS record details to your domain manager
2. Ask them to add: `_xxxxx.bonusaiapp.tathyas.in` â†’ `_xxxxx.acm-validations.aws.`
3. Wait for confirmation

---

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

After the script completes:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Visit: https://bonusaiapp.tathyas.in
3. You should see your AI Parenting App!

---

## Step 7: Add Link to Your Main Website

1. Edit your main tathyas.in website
2. Add a navigation link to: `https://bonusaiapp.tathyas.in`
3. Or upload the `landing-page.html` file we created

---

## Troubleshooting

### If the script fails:
1. **Check AWS credentials**: Run `aws sts get-caller-identity`
2. **Check internet connection**
3. **Try again**: The script is safe to run multiple times

### If the website doesn't load:
1. **Wait longer**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours
2. **Check certificate**: Make sure SSL validation completed
3. **Clear browser cache**: Press Ctrl+F5

### If you get stuck:
1. Take a screenshot of the error
2. Note exactly what step failed
